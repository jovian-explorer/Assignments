# Assignments
Assignments I have done as part of my course work here at IIT Indore


These are some of the assignments I had to do as a part of my coursework. My intention behind posting them here is to make them accessible for other astronomy students who may like to solve some of these problems on their own, for knowledge,as well as fun.

I am listing the subjects I studied here, feel free to contact me if any particular subject interests you, I'll share the assignments, as well as suggest some books for the same.

2. Astrophysical fluids and plasma

3. Quantum Mechanics

4. Electrodynamics

5. Astrostatistics 

5. Computational Dynamics

6. Galactic and extra-galactic astronomy
